(딱 필요한 만큼 있을 것만 있다. 심지어 컵라면까지.. ㅎㅎ) 어떤 여성분께서 접시에 한가득 담더니 엘리베이터를 타려고 하는 것을 보고 직원이 제지를 하러 나갔습니다. 몇 마디 나누더니 그냥 쌩~ 하고 엘리베이터를 타고 올라가 버립니다. 직원은 어이없다는 듯 더 이상의 제제를 하지 못하고 포기한 제 자기 자리로 돌아가는 것을 봤습니다. 만의 여인이 특급 호텔이었으면 저런 행동을 할 수 있었을까요? 얼마나 무시를 하면 저러가요? 그렇다면 여기를 이용하는 나 또한 저 사람 눈에는 그저 그런 무시해도 되는 사람인가? 만족하며 즐겁게 식사를 하는 나는 뭔가 하는 생각에 매우 불편함을 느꼈습니다. 호텔라오뉴를 좋아하는 우리 가족의 바람은 저런 사람을 보고도 어떤 조치도 취하지 않는 (못하는) 라오니 아닌 좋은 추억과 인상을 담을 수 있는, 그리고 그런 분위기를 제공할 수 있도록 관리를 해주셨으면 합니다.\n"

      "33 : 한국에 니시테츠 호텔 체인점이 있는 줄 알았으면 진짜에 이용했을 텐데, 늦게 알게 되어 아쉬움이 남습니다.   (장점)  - 접근성이 나쁘지 않습니다. (부산역에서 버스 15분)  - 로비가 3층이라 호텔 출입 시 블라이브 포장이 됩니다.  - 피로를 풀 수 있는 대욕탕과 피트니스 센터가 지하 1층에 있습니다.  - 직원분들이 매우 친절합니다.  - 방 청소 상태나 룸 컨디션이 일본 지점에 비해 훌륭합니다.  - 호텔 내부가 전체적으로 조용한 분위기입니다.  - 1층에 카페 체인점과 편의점이 있습니다.  - 빠른 체크인 가능(14시부터)   (단점)  - 통유리라서 외부 방음이 잘 안 됩니다. (차 경적 소리 등)  - 대욕탕은 유료 이용입니다(1일 이용 5,000원, 23시 종료).  - 에어컨이 일본 호텔에서 볼 수 있는 천장 일체형입니다. (탄, 온도, 풍속 등 개별 설정 가능)  - 대욕탕 및 부분은 보수가 필요합니다.  - 주변에서 긴일 해결하려면 좀 걸어야 합니다.   코로나 때문에 중국인을 포함한 외국 관광객이 없어서 세상 편하게 이용 잘했습니다. 주변에 유흥가가긴 한데, 호텔 이용하는 데는 지자 1도 없고, 확실히 토코인과 토요타 사이 중간 정도 퀄리티의 합리적인 비즈니스 호텔입니다. 출장하시는 분이나 혼자 여행하시는 분들이 숙박하면 만족할 숙소입니다. 자주 이용하고 싶은 곳입니다.\n"
